This project is meant to build a simple shell that is able to execute commands found in /bin.  The order of operation that this shell follows is from left to right.  When a # is detected all inputs after is ignored, ; runs command regardless if the previous command(s) was properly executed, the && runs command only if the left command(s) was successful and || run command if the left command(s) was unsuccessful. 
Know Bugs
